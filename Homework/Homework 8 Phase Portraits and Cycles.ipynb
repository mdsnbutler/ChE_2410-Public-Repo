    "# Phase portrait analysis of a chemostat\n",

    "Question from H.T. Banks and Marie Davidian\n",
    "\n",
    "A chemostat is a bioreactor where a microbial culture is continuously supplied with nutrients at a fixed rate and concomitantly harvested to keep the culture at a constant concentration. Chemostats are also used as microcosms in ecology and evolutionary biology as well as in wastewater treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we consider the problem of growth of micro-organisms, for example, a population of bacteria requiring an energy source containing carbon for growth (say a simple sugar). Suppose we have some bacteria in a container, and we add nutrients continuously in this container (i.e., a continuous culture medium). Assume the bacteria's growth depends on a limiting nutrient\n",
    "alone (i.e., all other nutrients are in excess and other conditions necessary for their growth are adequate). The container has an outlet so that nutrients and bacteria in the container can flow out. We further assume the container is well mixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- V be the volume of the chemost stat and equal to 1$L$.\n",
    "- Q be the fixed volumetric flow rate and equal to 1 $L/h$.\n",
    "- q = Q/V be the dilution rate ($h^{-1}$)\n",
    "- N(t) be the mass of bacteria at time t. \n",
    "- c(t) be the concentration of nutrients ($g/L$) and $c_0$ be the concentration of nutrients in the feed line, equal to 8 g/L.\n",
    "- r be the growth rate of bacteria ($h^{-1}$) where $r(c) = \\frac{R_{max}c(t)}{(K_m+c(t))}$. Let $K_m = 4$ and $R_{max}=2$. \n",
    "- y is the yield parameter equal to 0.25 $unitless$.\n",
